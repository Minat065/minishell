# Missing Files Report: minishell65 → minishell_tatsato

## Summary
This report identifies files that were present in minishell65 but are missing or relocated in minishell_tatsato after the integration.

## 1. Parser Test Files
**Status: ✅ All Copied**

All parser test files from minishell65 were successfully copied to minishell_tatsato:
- `test_heredoc.c`
- `test_operators.c`
- `test_pipe.c`
- `test_quote_handling.c`
- `test_redirection.c`
- `test_simple_command.c`

**Note**: The test executables (without .c extension) were also copied but may need to be recompiled.

## 2. Parser Documentation
**Status: ⚠️ Missing Files**

The following documentation files from minishell65/docs/ are **MISSING** in minishell_tatsato:
- `PARSER_DEVELOPMENT.md` - Important parser development documentation
- `GIT_WORKFLOW.md` - Git workflow guidelines
- `minishell-directory-structure.txt` - Project structure documentation
- `minishell-subject.md` - Original project subject
- `the-norm-md.md` - Coding norm documentation
- `token-definitions.txt` - Token type definitions

## 3. Parser-Related Headers
**Status: ✅ Relocated but Present**

- `token.h` was moved from `include/entities/` to `include/domain/`
- All parser interface headers are present in `include/interfaces/`

## 4. Entity Source Files
**Status: ❌ Missing File**

- **`token.c`** from `minishell65/src/entities/` is **MISSING** in minishell_tatsato
  - This file likely contains the implementation for token-related functions
  - Only `command.c` was transferred to the entities directory

## 5. Parser Source Files
**Status: ✅ All Copied**

All parser adapter files were successfully copied:
- `command_parser.c`
- `parser.c`
- `parser_factory.c`
- `parser_utils.c`
- `pipeline_parser.c`
- `redirection_parser.c`

## Critical Missing Files

### High Priority (Functionality Impact)
1. **`src/entities/token.c`** - Token implementation file

### Medium Priority (Documentation)
1. **`docs/PARSER_DEVELOPMENT.md`** - Parser development guide
2. **`docs/token-definitions.txt`** - Token type definitions

### Low Priority (Reference Documentation)
1. **`docs/GIT_WORKFLOW.md`**
2. **`docs/minishell-directory-structure.txt`**
3. **`docs/minishell-subject.md`**
4. **`docs/the-norm-md.md`**

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Action Required**:
   - Copy `token.c` from minishell65 to minishell_tatsato/src/entities/
   - Verify if token.c is needed or if its functionality was integrated elsewhere

2. **Documentation Recovery**:
   - Copy PARSER_DEVELOPMENT.md for parser maintenance
   - Copy token-definitions.txt for reference

3. **Build Verification**:
   - After copying token.c, rebuild the project to ensure no compilation errors
   - Run parser tests to verify functionality remains intact
